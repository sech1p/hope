# ðŸ“‚ Setting up hope

After you have installed hope, you need to setup it

## Installing dependencies

To install dependencies you need to do some commands. In PowerShell run each for of the following commands:

```powershell
PS C:\hopelocation> cd hope # Navigate to main folder
PS C:\hopelocation\hope> npm install # Install all dependencies
PS C:\hopelocation\hope> npm install -g bower # Install bower
PS C:\hopelocation\hope> cd src/web # Change directory to hope website
PS C:\hopelocation\hope\src\web> bower install # Install all bower dependencies
PS C:\hopelocation\hope\src\web> cd ../.. # Back to main directory
```

After this, you must get packages from external sources. To fetch them run:

```powershell
PS C:\hopelocation\hope> .\install-packages.bat # Install external packages
PS C:\hopelocation\hope> cd .\scripts\; .\fix-tio.ps1 # Fix TIO package
```

## Config

To configure bot, you must create and fill `.env` file in `hope\hope` folder. You can use a `.env.example` file as reference

## PostgreSQL

After you installed PostgreSQL, you need to configure it. Fill `.env` with values that you provided during Postgre installation, then search in Windows menu `psql` and run it.

```psql
Server [localhost]:
Database [postgres]: hope
Port [5432]:
Username [postgres]: your_username
Password for user x: your_password

hope=# CREATE SCHEMA hope;
hope=# \q
```

You finished setting up hope! Now type `npm run build; npm start` to build and run hope bot.
